# 🧠 AI-Enabled Operating Model Transformation

This portfolio project simulates a full-lifecycle transformation of an enterprise operating model powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). It follows the structured journey of a strategic consulting engagement — from stakeholder alignment and opportunity analysis to design, implementation, and board-level recommendations.

Built to demonstrate strategic thinking, structured problem-solving, and data-driven delivery, this repository reflects best practices for enterprise AI transformation.
