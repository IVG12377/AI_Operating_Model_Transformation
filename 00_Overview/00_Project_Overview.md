## 🚨 Client Brief

The COO of a global professional services firm has engaged you to lead a strategic transformation initiative. Despite consistent revenue growth, the company is experiencing rising costs, manual operational bottlenecks, and inconsistent service delivery across its client-facing and internal functions.

Past attempts at automation and tooling were localized — resulting in a patchwork of disconnected solutions and a frustrated leadership team. The ask: to design and lead a scalable operating model transformation that integrates process modernization and targeted use of AI to create measurable business impact.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Diagnose operational pain points and structural inefficiencies
- Align cross-functional stakeholders around a common transformation vision
- Identify and prioritize high-ROI automation and AI opportunities
- Design a future-state operating model focused on clarity, speed, and accountability
- Build a roadmap with quick wins and long-term transformation milestones
- Establish metrics to track adoption, performance, and value realization

---

## 🧭 Approach

The engagement follows a structured 7-phase transformation approach:

1. **Stakeholder Alignment** – Identify key influencers and decision-makers, map engagement strategy
2. **Current-State Analysis** – Map workflows, assess bottlenecks, define root causes
3. **Opportunity Analysis** – Identify automation and AI use cases, evaluate impact/effort
4. **Solution Design** – Define target-state processes, governance, and success criteria
5. **Implementation Roadmap** – Outline delivery phasing, change management, and risk mitigation
6. **Impact Measurement** – Define KPIs, tracking mechanisms, and feedback loops
7. **AI Learnings** – Explore applied tools, document insights and experiments

Frameworks used will include MECE, RACI, prioritization matrices, stakeholder maps, and AI decision guides.
