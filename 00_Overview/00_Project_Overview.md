# 🔍 00_Overview – Project Framing & Intent

Welcome to the brain of the operation.

This folder defines the **strategic intent**, **transformation thesis**, and **foundational logic** behind the AI Operating Model Transformation project. It’s not just where the story starts — it’s where it’s shaped.

## 🧭 Why This Project Exists

Organizations are overwhelmed by fragmented workflows, lagging decision cycles, and disconnected tooling. This simulation tackles that chaos head-on by applying enterprise-grade AI thinking, layered with structured consulting frameworks, to design a future-ready operating model.

This isn’t a product demo.  
This is a full-cycle transformation case — from stakeholder alignment to strategic value realization — built to show how AI can accelerate meaningful change.
