# 📋 00_Overview | Project Foundation

> **Establishing the framework and governance for AI operating model transformation**

This folder contains the foundational documents that simulate how a consulting team would initiate and structure an enterprise AI transformation engagement.

---

## 📌 Phase Purpose

The **Overview phase** establishes the project foundation—defining scope, methodology, governance, and success criteria that guide the entire transformation simulation.

**Consulting Parallel**: *This mirrors the "Project Kickoff" phase where consultants establish engagement parameters, stakeholder alignment, and delivery frameworks.*
