## üîç Notes & Guidelines

### **RACI Best Practices**
- **One A per activity**: Avoid confusion by having single accountability
- **Limit C roles**: Too many consultations slow decision-making
- **Clear deliverables**: Each R role has specific, measurable outputs
- **Regular reviews**: Monthly validation ensures relevance

### **Cultural Considerations**
- **Matrix organizations**: Some stakeholders may have multiple RACI roles
- **Geographic distribution**: Virtual collaboration may require process adjustments
- **Organizational hierarchy**: RACI reflects project roles, not org chart positions
- **Change readiness**: Some stakeholders may need coaching on new responsibilities

### **Integration Points**
- **Communication Plan**: RACI informs who needs what information when
- **Stakeholder Map**: Power/interest analysis validates appropriate role assignments
- **Project Timeline**: RACI responsibilities align with project milestones
- **Risk Management**: Role clarity reduces execution and accountability risks
