## 🗺️ Stakeholder Engagement Map

This visual classifies stakeholders based on their **level of influence** and **level of interest** in the transformation. It enables the team to prioritize engagement methods by stakeholder group:

- **Manage Closely**: Executive sponsors, compliance leads — critical to success  
- **Keep Satisfied**: IT and finance leaders — high power, less involved  
- **Keep Informed**: Department leads and user groups — provide insight  
- **Monitor**: Admin or support roles — low risk, passive observers

By visualizing this matrix early, the project builds trust and preempts friction in later phases.
