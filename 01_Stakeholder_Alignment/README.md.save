## 🗺️ Stakeholder Strategy Overview

Stakeholders are segmented based on their role in driving, approving, or adopting AI initiatives. Key groups include:

- **Executive Sponsors** – Provide vision, funding, and visibility  
- **Business Unit Leaders** – Enable use case delivery and change buy-in  
- **Data & Technology Owners** – Manage platforms, pipelines, and integration  
- **Operational Teams** – Implement AI-enabled workflows  
- **Legal & Risk** – Guide compliance, security, and ethical guardrails

Each group is mapped to one of four engagement strategies:
