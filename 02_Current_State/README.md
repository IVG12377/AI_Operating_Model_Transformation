## üß© Client Onboarding Workflow

This visual illustrates the current-state onboarding process across Hiring, HR, Compliance, IT, and Operations. It captures **handoffs, delays, and process silos** that impact Day 1 readiness.

The diagram is used in stakeholder sessions to highlight friction and surface early automation opportunities like auto-provisioning, pre-filled compliance forms, and template-driven hiring requests.
