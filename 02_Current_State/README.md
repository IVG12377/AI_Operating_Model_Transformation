## üß© Client Onboarding Workflow

This diagram shows the current-state client onboarding flow, spanning Hiring, HR, Compliance, IT, and Operations. It reveals **delays, manual dependencies, and ownership ambiguity** ‚Äî all of which contribute to poor Day 1 readiness.

By visualizing these breakdowns, the team can more easily:

- Prioritize automation (e.g., IT provisioning)
- Highlight gaps in compliance readiness
- Engage functional leaders with data-backed insights

This graphic also serves as a tool for stakeholder workshops and readiness discussions.
