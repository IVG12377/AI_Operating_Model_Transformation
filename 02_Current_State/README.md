# 🏗️ 02_Current_State

This folder captures the baseline analysis of the organization’s current operating model. It includes workflow diagrams, manual process identification, and key constraints observed during the discovery phase.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Establish a shared understanding of existing business processes  
- Identify inefficiencies, redundancies, and handoff issues  
- Provide a diagnostic foundation for AI opportunity discovery

## 🧮 Process Overview

This phase documented the end-to-end operations across departments, including HR, Finance, and Customer Support. Swimlane diagrams helped identify manual dependencies, data entry duplication, and lack of integration between systems.

---

## ❗ Operational Pain Points

- Excessive manual handoffs between teams  
- Redundant data entry across disconnected systems  
- Delays in approval workflows due to unclear ownership  
- Limited visibility into task status and completion

These challenges directly informed AI use case selection in Folder `03_Opportunity_Analysis`.

## 🔁 Connected Decisions

Relevant project decisions based on this phase:

- **D002:** Used swimlane mapping to identify friction and inform opportunity ranking  
  → See [Project Decision Log](../11_Project_Decision_Log/README.md) for rationale

## ✅ Outcome

This current-state assessment created the foundation for targeted AI interventions and supported stakeholder consensus around key inefficiencies ripe for transformation.
