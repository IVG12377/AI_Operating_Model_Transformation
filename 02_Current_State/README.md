# 📊 02_Current_State | Baseline Assessment & Analysis

> **Comprehensive assessment of current operating model to establish transformation baseline**

This folder contains detailed analysis of the current state across processes, technology, organization, and performance metrics. These assessments establish the baseline for measuring transformation impact and identifying optimization opportunities.

---

## 📌 Phase Overview

The **Current State Assessment** phase provides comprehensive documentation and analysis of existing operations before AI transformation. This phase establishes the factual foundation for all subsequent analysis and design work.

**Consulting Parallel**: *This mirrors the "Diagnostic" phase where consultants conduct detailed current state analysis to understand baseline performance and identify improvement opportunities.*
