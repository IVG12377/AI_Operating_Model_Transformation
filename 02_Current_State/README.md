## 🧮 Process Overview

This phase documented the end-to-end operations across departments, including HR, Finance, and Customer Support. Swimlane diagrams helped identify manual dependencies, data entry duplication, and lack of integration between systems.

## ❗ Operational Pain Points

- Excessive manual handoffs between teams
- Redundant data entry across disconnected systems
- Delays in approval workflows due to unclear ownership
- Limited visibility into task status and completion

These challenges directly informed AI use case selection in Folder `03_Opportunity_Analysis`.
