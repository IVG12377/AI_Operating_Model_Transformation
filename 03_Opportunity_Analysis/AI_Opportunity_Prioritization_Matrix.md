# üìä AI Opportunity Prioritization Matrix

**Document Purpose**: Visual prioritization analysis of AI automation opportunities  
**Analysis Method**: Impact vs Effort scoring with ROI and feasibility considerations  
**Data Source**: Process opportunity analysis and current state baseline metrics  
**Last Updated**: June 2025

---

## üìå Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates five AI automation opportunities using a systematic impact-effort framework. **Employee Onboarding** emerges as the ideal quick win (high impact, low effort), while **Document Processing** offers the best balance of strategic value and implementation feasibility for our MVP selection.

**Recommended Approach**: Pursue Employee Onboarding as immediate quick win, followed by Document Processing (invoice matching) as strategic MVP.
