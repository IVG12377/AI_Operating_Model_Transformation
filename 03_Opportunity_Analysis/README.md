## üí∞ ROI Quantification

Based on performance baseline metrics from Phase 2 analysis:

### **Invoice Matching Automation** *(MVP Selection)*

#### **Current State Impact**
- **Process**: Manual invoice processing and approval workflows  
- **Current Cost**: Part of $92K annual budget planning process inefficiency  
- **Time Investment**: 32 hours manual consolidation + 4.3 review iterations  
- **Error Rate**: Version control issues in 12 instances per planning cycle

#### **Automation Potential**
- **Efficiency Gain**: 60% reduction in manual processing time  
- **Error Reduction**: 85% fewer version control and matching errors  
- **Cycle Time**: 3-day reduction in monthly close processes  
- **Annual Savings**: **$67,000** (staff time + error correction + faster close)

#### **Implementation Investment**
- **Technology Platform**: $35,000 (AI-powered invoice matching solution)  
- **Integration & Setup**: $15,000 (system integration and testing)  
- **Training & Change**: $8,000 (staff training and process documentation)  
- **Total Investment**: **$58,000**

#### **Financial Returns**
- **Payback Period**: 10.4 months  
- **3-Year ROI**: 245%  
- **NPV (10% discount)**: $114,000  
- **Risk-Adjusted ROI**: 195% (accounting for 20% implementation risk)

### **Comparative ROI Analysis**

| Use Case | Annual Savings | Implementation Cost | Payback Period | 3-Year ROI |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Invoice Matching** | $67K | $58K | 10.4 months | **245%** |
| Email Triage | $42K | $75K | 21.4 months | 68% |
| Doc Classification | $38K | $85K | 26.8 months | 34% |
| Customer Support | $56K | $95K | 20.3 months | 77% |

## üîç Feasibility Notes

| Use Case | Feasibility Considerations | Implementation Risk |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Invoice Matching** | Clean historical data available; simple business rules | **Low** |
| Email Triage | Requires NLP modeling and email labeling schema | Medium |
| Doc Classification | Good data, but needs labeled training set | Medium |
| Customer Support | Requires time-series and historic tagging logic | High |
