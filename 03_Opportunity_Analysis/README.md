## üìä AI Opportunity Prioritization Matrix

The visual below maps key opportunities using a 2x2 matrix that classifies them into categories such as **Quick Wins**, **Strategic Bets**, **Low-Hanging Fruit**, and **Avoid/Defer**. This framework enables decision-makers to prioritize initiatives based on ROI potential and ease of execution.

## üéØ Strategic Insight

This opportunity scan helps stakeholders focus resources on the initiatives most likely to drive immediate value (e.g., onboarding automation) while building the case for longer-term investments like predictive analytics or generative documentation workflows.

By visualizing trade-offs, the matrix also supports **cross-functional alignment** during solution planning, helping avoid wasteful experimentation or siloed initiatives.
