# üîç 03_Opportunity_Analysis

This folder identifies, assesses, and prioritizes high-impact AI opportunities across key operational areas. The goal is to align automation efforts with business value by evaluating both the *potential impact* and the *level of implementation effort* required.

## üìä AI Opportunity Prioritization Matrix

This 2x2 matrix plots AI use cases based on **business impact vs. implementation effort**. It categorizes opportunities into four strategic zones:

- **Quick Wins**: High ROI, low complexity (e.g., onboarding automation)  
- **Strategic Bets**: High-value but more complex (e.g., predictive attrition)  
- **Low-Hanging Fruit**: Simple automations with modest value  
- **Avoid/Defer**: High effort, low value (e.g., sensitive contract parsing)

This prioritization framework enables alignment across business, IT, and compliance stakeholders while focusing resources on achievable early wins.

## üéØ Strategic Insight

This opportunity scan helps stakeholders focus resources on the initiatives most likely to drive immediate value (e.g., onboarding automation) while building the case for longer-term investments like predictive analytics or generative documentation workflows.

By visualizing trade-offs, the matrix also supports **cross-functional alignment** during solution planning, helping avoid wasteful experimentation or siloed initiatives.
