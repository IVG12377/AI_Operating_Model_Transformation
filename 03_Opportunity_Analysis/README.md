## üìä AI Opportunity Prioritization Matrix

This matrix evaluates potential AI initiatives by **business impact** and **implementation effort**, categorizing them into four strategy zones:

- **Quick Wins** ‚Äì High impact, low effort (e.g., onboarding automation)
- **Strategic Bets** ‚Äì High value, high complexity (e.g., predictive attrition)
- **Low-Hanging Fruit** ‚Äì Simple tasks with modest ROI (e.g., calendar bots)
- **Defer** ‚Äì High effort, low reward (e.g., sensitive AI contract parsing)

The framework enables teams to align leadership on what‚Äôs achievable in the short term vs. where investment is needed for long-term ROI.
