## 📈 Key Insights

- **Income Effect:** Employees in the lowest income quartile exhibit **65% higher attrition**  
- **Tenure Window:** Employees in the 2–4 year range are **40% more likely to leave** than long-tenured peers  
- **Promotion Lag:** Risk increases **2.3x** when promotion hasn’t occurred in 3+ years  
- **Role-Specific Risk:** Sales and support staff have **35% above-average turnover**, even with competitive pay  
- **Generational Impact:** **Age and attrition correlate strongly** (r = 0.90), signaling shifting retention dynamics  
- **Workload Pattern:** Younger employees work more overtime (r = -0.46), suggesting potential burnout
