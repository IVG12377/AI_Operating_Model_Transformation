# 📊 04_Data_Analysis – Insight Generation & Operational Diagnostics

This folder translates raw data into strategic insight, forming the analytical foundation for AI-driven transformation. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we surface patterns, outliers, and friction points that inform both the opportunity framing and solution design.

This is where the "what" becomes the "so what."

---

## 🧠 Purpose of This Folder

- Perform data-driven exploration of current workflows
- Identify friction points, bottlenecks, and failure modes
- Validate assumptions from upstream stakeholder input
- Ground solution design in real operational trends
