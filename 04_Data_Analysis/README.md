# üìä 04_Data_Analysis ‚Äì Evidence-Based AI Strategy

This folder presents comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) that validates AI opportunities and quantifies business impact potential. The analysis provides data-driven evidence to support transformation recommendations and ROI projections.

---

## üìå Purpose

Transform raw data into actionable insights that:
- **Validate AI use case selection** with quantified business impact
- **Support $2.1M annual savings projection** with evidence-based modeling  
- **Identify high-risk employee segments** for predictive intervention strategies
- **Provide baseline metrics** for measuring transformation success

## üîç Key Insights Discovered

### **Critical Risk Patterns**
- **29.3%** attrition rate in lowest income quartile employees
- **58.8%** attrition rate among young employees (18-29 years)
- **30.5%** attrition rate for overtime workers vs **10.4%** for standard hours
- **20.6%** attrition in Sales department (highest risk)

### **Predictive Model Indicators**
- **Age correlation**: r = 0.90 with attrition (strongest predictor)
- **Overtime impact**: 3x higher attrition risk for overtime workers
- **Income effect**: Low-income employees show 65% higher attrition risk
- **Tenure window**: 2-4 year employees are 40% more likely to leave
