## 🔁 Potential Enhancements to Current Attrition Solutions

| Idea | Description | Business Impact | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Escalation Cascade for High-Risk Employees** | If manager doesn't act on attrition alert within 72 hrs, auto-escalate to HR Business Partner, then Director | Ensures no high-risk employee falls through cracks | In Design |
| **Employee Self-Service Risk Dashboard** | Let employees see their own "retention health score" with improvement suggestions | Proactive self-advocacy, transparency builds trust | Drafting |
| **Compensation Gap Auto-Detection** | Flag employees earning significantly below market rate for their role/tenure | Address #1 attrition driver identified in data analysis | Proposed |
| **Peer Retention Network Mapping** | Identify when multiple team members are at risk simultaneously | Prevent "attrition contagion" in teams | Researching |
