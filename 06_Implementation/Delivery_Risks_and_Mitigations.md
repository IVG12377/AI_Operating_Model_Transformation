## 🔍 Top Implementation Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Resource Constraints** | Workstream SMEs may be overallocated or unavailable | Identify backups early; stagger workload by phase |
| **Data Readiness** | Poor data quality or system access delays can stall automation build | Conduct data audits early; create UAT-ready sandbox |
| **Stakeholder Misalignment** | Competing departmental priorities may affect engagement | Host weekly alignment syncs and enforce RACI accountability |
| **Change Resistance** | End-users may be hesitant to adopt new workflows | Use change champions and embed in-app training |
| **Timeline Slippage** | Delays in dependencies or late feedback loops | Use timeline buffers and checkpoint gates to stay agile |
