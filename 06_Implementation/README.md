# 🚀 06_Implementation

This folder outlines the implementation roadmap for deploying the proposed AI-enabled operating model transformation. It provides a phased timeline, defined ownership roles, risk planning, and coordinated workstreams to ensure execution readiness across all functional areas.

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

A 12-week phased timeline highlights the four core stages of implementation: **Plan**, **Design**, **Build**, and **Launch**.

## 👥 RACI Matrix

This matrix defines role clarity for all key contributors using the RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) model — ensuring governance and cross-functional accountability.

## 🧠 Key Execution Principles

- 🧭 **Phased Planning**: Clear, staged implementation reduces risk and accelerates learning  
- 👥 **Role Clarity**: RACI ensures decisions are defined, owned, and acted on swiftly  
- 🚦 **Tracking and Governance**: Dashboards and cadence create execution momentum  
- 🛡️ **Proactive Risk Management**: Risks are visible, assigned, and actively mitigated  

> 💡 This folder is designed to support program managers, transformation leads, and executive sponsors in operationalizing the AI-enabled operating model. All materials are presentation-ready and scalable across enterprise delivery contexts.
