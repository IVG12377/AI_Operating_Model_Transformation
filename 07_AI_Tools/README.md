### 2. Communicate Visually
- Use Slide 2 of the `MiniDeck` to show the **AI Fit Priority Matrix** — a bubble chart visualizing impact vs. effort
- Use the deck for executive briefings, strategic framing, and linking back to GitHub workstreams

### 3. Link to Execution
- Feed top-scoring opportunities into Folder 05 (`Strategic_Recommendations`)
- Use checklist logic and scoring to define dashboards and KPIs in Folder 06 (`Execution_Plan`)
