## ðŸ§­ AI Maturity Scoring (Example)

A firm may assess itself using a diagnostic scoring sheet (1â€“5 scale for each dimension), then map results to a composite maturity level. Example:

| Dimension               | Score (1â€“5) |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Data Readiness          | 3           |
| Talent & Skills         | 2           |
| Technology Enablement   | 3           |
| Governance & Risk       | 2           |
| Use Case Portfolio      | 3           |
| Change Adoption         | 2           |
| **Composite Maturity**  | **Level 2: Emerging** |
