## 🧠 Strategic Design Principles

- **Business-Led, Tech-Enabled**: AI is deployed to serve measurable business goals, not as standalone tech experiments.
- **Scalable Governance**: All models and automations are governed through reusable, auditable, and ethical structures.
- **Value Reinforcement**: Change management, training, and feedback loops ensure that gains are sustained beyond launch.
- **Transparency & Trust**: Frameworks include human oversight, model explainability, and compliant data usage.
