## ðŸ§° AI Tool Prioritization Framework

To effectively integrate AI into business processes, we utilize a structured framework that evaluates potential tools based on:

- **Impact**: Potential value addition  
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity  
- **Maturity**: Readiness level  
- **ROI**: Expected return on investment  

This framework surfaces high-value, low-effort AI opportunities with strong business alignment.
