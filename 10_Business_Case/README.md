# ğŸ’¼ 10_Business_Case â€“ Financial Model & ROI

This folder presents the financial justification for the AI-enabled operating model transformation. It models the total investment required, quantifies expected value creation, and visualizes return-on-investment (ROI) across multiple scenarios to support informed decision-making.

---

## ğŸ“Œ Purpose

- Evaluate cost vs. value of the proposed transformation  
- Calculate ROI, net benefit, and breakeven timing  
- Communicate risk-adjusted value through visuals and scenario planning
