# 💼 10_Business_Case – Financial Model & ROI

This folder presents the financial justification for the AI-enabled operating model transformation. It models the total investment required, quantifies expected value creation, and visualizes return-on-investment (ROI) across multiple scenarios to support informed decision-making.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Evaluate cost vs. value of the proposed transformation
- Calculate ROI, net benefit, and breakeven timing
- Communicate risk-adjusted value through visuals and scenario planning

| **Implementation (Consulting)** | Setup, integration, and vendor enablement (e.g. Accenture, SEI) |
| **Change Management** | Communication strategy, training, and adoption support |
| **Internal Resources** | Internal FTE allocation from Ops, Risk, IT, HR |
| **Ongoing Support** | Post-launch tuning, retraining, and AI monitoring |

### ![ROI Payback Curve](./ROI_Payback_Curve.png)  
📈 *This curve shows when cumulative benefits from the AI transformation surpass total investment. Breakeven occurs around Month 20, signaling strong ROI in Year 2.*

---

### ![Cost vs. Value by Category](./Cost_vs_Value_by_Category.png)  
💰 *Side-by-side comparison of where money is invested (cost inputs) vs. where it’s saved or gained (value streams). Useful for executive decision-making and prioritization.*
