# 🧾 Scenario_Assumptions.md

This file documents the assumptions behind the ROI model for the AI-enabled operating model transformation. It outlines inputs across three financial planning scenarios: **Conservative**, **Expected**, and **Best Case** — providing clarity into cost, value, and adoption drivers.

## 📊 Key Dimensions

| Area | Assumption Category | Description |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Costs** | AI Tooling | Fixed license cost across all scenarios |
|           | Implementation | Lowered in Year 2, remains constant in all cases |
|           | Internal Time | Conservative assumes more internal hours due to slower enablement |
|           | Change Mgmt | Fixed with slight ramp-down in Year 2 |

| **Value** | FTE Time Saved | Varies based on automation coverage + cycle time reduction |
|           | SLA Savings | Conservative assumes minimal gains; best case assumes near-perfect adherence |
|           | AI Adoption | Conservative: 60%, Expected: 76%, Best: 90% |
|           | Efficiency Lift | Driven by usage + process redesign; modeled per workflow |

## 📈 Scenario Overview

| Scenario | ROI (%) | Payback Period | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Conservative** | ~35% | ~30 months | Delayed adoption, partial automation, higher internal drag |
| **Expected**     | ~62% | ~20 months | Baseline forecast; aligned to Folder 08 impact metrics |
| **Best Case**    | ~95% | ~14 months | High adoption, faster execution, stronger cultural readiness |

## 🔍 Assumptions Highlights

- Productivity gains are tied to FTE hours saved (approx. 3,000–4,000 hours per year)  
- SLA compliance gains modeled as cost avoidance (e.g., fewer missed deadlines, rework)  
- Cycle time reduction leads to throughput increase, not just savings  
- AI tool adoption varies with scenario and impacts value realization curve  
- License and platform costs are fixed regardless of adoption rate
