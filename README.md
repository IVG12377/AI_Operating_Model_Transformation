# üöÄ Operating Model Transformation with AI-Enabled Process Modernization

This portfolio project simulates a large-scale operating model transformation for a global professional services firm. It demonstrates how structured consulting methodology, stakeholder alignment, and targeted AI adoption can deliver measurable business outcomes.
